# Why using React
React provides an easy way to build web applications and web user interfaces

package.json
```
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
```

## Declarative UI programming
In React, we define the target UI state(s), not the steps to get there.

## Imperative UI programming
Vanilla JavaScript is Imperative programming, we need to define all the steps.
